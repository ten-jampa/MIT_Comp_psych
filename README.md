# MIT_Comp_psych
Primary to store the solutions or the implementation of the google colab notebooks for MIT's 6.S094 (Architecture of the Mind) class during IAP. May use the repository to also store any subsequent projects or experiments I conduct related to such matters of computational psychology and cognition.
